## Introduction

Queue's are a handy data structure found in most languages. This tutorial is for the Python Lnaguage. 

## Types of Queues

Queues as a data structure are pretty straightforward. There are three main examples of a queue that may help explain what the Queue data structure is and how it works.

## Queue Commands

The commands for working with a queue are fairly simple. There are 4 main operations for the queue datastructure. 
 

Operation | Description | Code Example(Python) | Big O Notation
-------- | -------- | -------- |----------
<b>enqueue(value) | this is used to add a value to the back of the queue.| `my_queue.append(value)` | hi there
<b>dequeue() | Removes the item at the front of the queue. Two options: remove and return the front item or pop off index 0. | `value = my_queue[0], del my_queue[0]` <b>or</b> `value = my_queue.pop(0)` | hit there
<b>size() | This returns the size of the queue. | `length = len(my_queue)` | H there
<b>empty() | This returns true of the length of the queu is zero, aka if the queue is empty. | `if len(my_queue) == 0:` | thi there

## Example

I NEED IDEA'S I'M SO LOST ON THIS

## Problem to Solve

THIS ONE'S EVEN WORSE I FEEL LIKE I NEED SOMETHING THAT SHOWS HOW IT CAN BE USED IN MORE COMPLEX WAYS CUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
